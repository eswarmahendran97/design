B+ tree - Heavy read
LSM tree - Heavy write

On read
LSM need to go through memtable then to all sstables to find the data
B+ will transverse and find pageId the goes to table page

On write
b+ need to transverse in same way(Random I/o) and writes in table page
LSM updates memtable(small) then creates new sstable file sequentually

On update
b+ need to transverse in same way(Random I/o) and updates in table page
LSM creates new file and mark old one as tombstoned(so processing will be more while read). Actual removal happens during compaction later.
